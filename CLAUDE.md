```

## Essential Commands

### Built-in Commands
- `/compact` - Minimize context usage when approaching token limits
- `/clear` - Clear conversation history for fresh start
- `/init` - Initialize CLAUDE.md for your project
- `/bug` - Report issues directly to Anthropic
- `#` - Add information to CLAUDE.md during conversation

### Custom Commands
Place custom command files in `.claude/commands/` directory:
- `/project:build` - Run build process
- `/project:test` - Execute test suite
- `/project:deploy` - Deploy application

## Code Style Guidelines

### General Principles
- Be explicit about coding patterns and conventions
- Use consistent naming conventions across the project
- Prefer functional programming patterns where appropriate
- Always handle errors gracefully
- **Document every change with comments**
- **Commit frequently with descriptive messages**
- **Maintain organized file structure**

### File Organization
- Place all logs in `logs/` folder
- Move documentation to `docs/` folder
- Keep scripts in `scripts/` folder
- Clean up temporary files after use
- Remove duplicate or test files
- Update CLAUDE.md with new file references

### Language-Specific Examples

#### JavaScript/TypeScript
- Use ES modules (import/export), not CommonJS (require)
- Destructure imports when possible
- Use arrow functions for component definitions
- Prefer async/await over promises

#### Python
- Use type hints for all functions
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use virtual environments (specify setup in CLAUDE.md)
- Prefer pathlib over os.path

#### Other Languages
- Adapt these principles to your language
- Document your specific conventions in CLAUDE.md
- Include language-specific tools and linters

## MCP Server Configuration

### Essential Servers
- `filesystem` - File operations with access controls
- `git` - Version control operations
- `memory` - Persistent context across sessions
- `postgresql`/`mysql` - Database operations

### Installation
```bash
# Install MCP servers via npm or appropriate package manager
npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem
npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-git
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Insufficient Context
- ‚ùå Vague project descriptions
- ‚úÖ Detailed architecture, commands, and patterns in CLAUDE.md

### 2. Poor Command Documentation
- ‚ùå No clear command structure
- ‚úÖ Explicit commands with examples

### 3. Missing Environment Setup
- ‚ùå No environment configuration
- ‚úÖ Clear setup instructions with versions

### 4. Ignoring Error Patterns
- ‚ùå No error handling guidance
- ‚úÖ Document common errors and solutions

### 5. Not Using MCP Servers
- ‚ùå Relying only on base Claude capabilities
- ‚úÖ Install relevant MCP servers for your workflow

### 6. Not Preventing Assumptions
- ‚ùå Letting Claude make implementation choices
- ‚úÖ Be explicit: "Ask before choosing libraries"
- ‚úÖ Add to CLAUDE.md: "Always confirm approach before implementing"
- ‚úÖ Use phrases like "Do not assume" in instructions

### 7. Context Degradation
- ‚ùå Continuing after hours without clearing
- ‚úÖ Use `/clear` frequently for new tasks
- ‚úÖ Use `/compact` proactively at checkpoints
- ‚úÖ Create task checklists to track progress

### 8. False Completion Claims
- ‚ùå Accepting "everything is complete" at face value
- ‚úÖ Maintain a todo.md checklist
- ‚úÖ Ask Claude to verify each item explicitly
- ‚úÖ Use Task() subagents for verification

## Performance Optimization

### Context Management
- Monitor context usage indicator
- Use `/compact` proactively at natural breakpoints
- Consider `/clear` when switching major tasks
- Keep CLAUDE.md concise and well-organized
- **Clear context after 1-2 hours of work**
- **Create session summaries before clearing**

### Managing Long Sessions
After extended work sessions, Claude's accuracy degrades:
1. **Use `/clear` frequently** - Best practice for maintaining accuracy
2. **Create checkpoint files** - Save state before clearing
3. **Use todo.md checklists** - Track incomplete items
4. **Verify completion claims** - Always double-check

Example checkpoint file:
```markdown
# Session Summary - [Date/Time]

## Completed
- ‚úÖ Implemented user authentication
- ‚úÖ Added database migrations

## In Progress
- ‚è≥ API endpoint for user profiles (50% done)

## TODO
- ‚ùå Write unit tests
- ‚ùå Update documentation
- ‚ùå Deploy to staging

## Next Steps
Continue with API endpoint, then tests
```

### Token Usage
- Use headless mode (`claude -p`) for simple tasks
- Pipe data efficiently: `cat data.csv | claude -p "analyze"`
- Configure OpenTelemetry for usage tracking

### Workflow Automation
Create reusable slash commands:
```markdown
# .claude/commands/full-deploy.md
Complete deployment process:

1. Run tests: `npm test`
2. Build: `npm run build`  
3. Deploy: `npm run deploy`
4. Verify: `npm run verify-deployment`
```

### File Organization Command
```markdown
# .claude/commands/organize-files.md
Organize project files:

1. Move all *.log files to logs/
2. Move all *.md files (except README.md and CLAUDE.md) to docs/
3. Move all *.sh, *.py scripts to scripts/
4. Clean up any .tmp, .temp, or duplicate files
5. Update CLAUDE.md with new file locations
6. Commit changes with message "chore: Organize project structure"
```

## CLAUDE.md Best Practices

### Structure
```markdown
# Project Name

## Overview
Brief description of project purpose and architecture

## Tech Stack
- [Your specific framework/language]
- [Your database choice]
- [Other key technologies]

## Commands
- [Your build command] - Build the project
- [Your test command] - Run tests
- [Your dev command] - Start development

## Code Style
- [Language-specific style guide]
- [Your linting rules]
- [Your formatting preferences]

## Project Guidelines
- Branch naming: [your convention]
- Commit format: [your format]
- PR process: [your requirements]

## Common Issues
1. [Project-specific issue] - [Solution]
2. [Another common issue] - [Fix]

## Important Rules
- Always ask before choosing implementation approach
- Never assume file locations or structures
- Confirm library choices before installing
- Do not refactor without explicit permission
- Check existing implementations before creating new ones
- **Document all changes and additions**
- **Commit after each significant change**
- **Clean up temporary/debug files**
- **Organize files into proper directories**
- **Update CLAUDE.md with new documentation links**

## File Management
<file_organization>
1. After creating any document, move it to docs/
2. Place all scripts in scripts/ folder
3. Move log files to logs/ folder
4. Delete temporary files after debugging
5. Remove duplicate files immediately
6. Update CLAUDE.md with links to new docs:
   - [[docs/api-guide.md]] - API documentation
   - [[docs/setup.md]] - Setup instructions
   - [[scripts/deploy.sh]] - Deployment script
</file_organization>

## Commit Strategy
<commit_rules>
1. Commit after implementing each feature
2. Commit before starting debugging
3. Commit after fixing each bug
4. Use descriptive commit messages:
   - feat: Add user authentication
   - fix: Resolve database connection issue
   - docs: Update API documentation
   - chore: Clean up temporary files
5. **Do NOT include Claude attribution**
   - No "Co-Authored-By: Claude"
   - No "Generated with Claude Code"
   - No AI attribution in messages
</commit_rules>

## Git Configuration
<git_setup>
1. Ensure your Git identity is configured:
   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
   ```

2. Add to CLAUDE.md to prevent co-author attribution:
   ```markdown
   ## Git Commit Rules
   - Never add "Co-Authored-By: Claude" to commits
   - Do not include AI attribution in commit messages
   - Use the configured Git user identity
   - Keep commit messages professional and concise
   ```

3. Example proper commit command:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: Add user authentication"
   # NOT: git commit -m "feat: Add user authentication

   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
   ```
</git_setup>
```

### Key Points
- Keep it concise and scannable
- Use markdown formatting effectively
- Update regularly as project evolves
- Include specific examples
- Document what NOT to do
- **Be explicit about preventing assumptions**
- **Add rules that persist across conversations**
- **Include file organization rules**
- **Link all documentation back to CLAUDE.md**
- **Explicitly prohibit Claude attribution in commits**

### Preventing Co-Author Attribution
Based on community feedback, Claude Code automatically adds attribution which many teams don't want. Add this to your CLAUDE.md:

```markdown
## Git Commit Standards
- NEVER include "Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
- Do not add "ü§ñ Generated with Claude Code" to messages
- Use only the configured Git user identity
- Professional commit messages without AI attribution
- Follow conventional commit format (feat:, fix:, etc.)
```

### Example Organization Section
```markdown
## Project Organization
- All documentation must go in docs/
- Scripts and utilities in scripts/
- Log files in logs/
- Clean up temp files after each task
- Update this file with new doc links

## Documentation Index
- [[docs/README.md]] - Main documentation
- [[docs/api.md]] - API reference
- [[docs/contributing.md]] - Contribution guide
- [[scripts/build.sh]] - Build script
- [[scripts/test.py]] - Test runner

## Git Configuration
- Use configured user.name and user.email
- NO Claude attribution in commits
- NO "Co-Authored-By" lines
- Clean, professional commit messages only
```

### Preventing Claude from Forgetting Rules
Based on research, Claude can forget rules as conversations grow. To prevent this:
1. Add self-referential rules at the end of CLAUDE.md
2. Use XML tags for important rules
3. Ask Claude to update CLAUDE.md when it makes mistakes

Example:
```markdown
## Critical Rules (Always Apply)
<rules>
1. Ask before choosing any library or framework
2. Confirm approach before implementing features
3. Never assume file locations - always verify
4. Do not make changes outside requested scope
5. Always display these rules at the end of responses
</rules>
```

## Advanced Techniques

### Documentation and Organization
Claude Code should maintain a clean, organized project:

1. **Automatic Documentation**
   ```markdown
   ## Documentation Rules
   - Create README.md for each new module
   - Add inline comments for complex logic
   - Generate API docs for public functions
   - Link all docs in CLAUDE.md
   ```

2. **Regular Cleanup Tasks**
   ```markdown
   ## After Each Session
   - Delete all .tmp and .temp files
   - Remove console.log statements
   - Move files to appropriate folders
   - Update documentation links
   - Commit all changes
   ```

3. **CLAUDE.md Documentation Index**
   ```markdown
   ## Project Documentation
   - [[docs/architecture.md]] - System architecture
   - [[docs/api-reference.md]] - API documentation
   - [[docs/setup-guide.md]] - Setup instructions
   - [[scripts/deploy.sh]] - Deployment script
   - [[scripts/backup.py]] - Backup utility
   ```

### Preventing Assumptions
Claude Code tends to make assumptions about implementation. Combat this by:

1. **Explicit Instructions in CLAUDE.md**
   ```markdown
   ## Before Implementation
   - Always ask which library/framework to use
   - Confirm file locations before creating
   - Verify naming conventions
   - Check for existing implementations
   ```

2. **Use Thinking Mode**
   - "think" - 4,000 tokens thinking budget
   - "think hard" - 10,000 tokens
   - "think harder" - 31,999 tokens
   - "ultrathink" - Maximum thinking budget

3. **Update CLAUDE.md After Mistakes**
   When Claude makes an incorrect assumption:
   ```
   > How can you modify CLAUDE.md to prevent this issue in future?
   ```

### Maintaining Accuracy in Long Sessions

1. **The `/clear` Strategy**
   - Clear context every 1-2 hours
   - Clear when switching between unrelated tasks
   - Save session summary before clearing

2. **Task Tracking Pattern**
   ```
   1. Create todo.md at start
   2. Ask Claude to read todo.md before each task
   3. Update todo.md after each completion
   4. Verify against todo.md before claiming done
   ```

3. **Verification Commands**
   ```markdown
   # .claude/commands/verify-complete.md
   Check todo.md and for each incomplete item:
   1. Search for implementation
   2. If found, mark complete
   3. If not found, implement it
   4. Show me the code for each item
   ```

### Multi-Model Workflow
- Use Claude Opus for planning and architecture
- Switch to Sonnet (Shift+Tab) for implementation
- CLAUDE.md ensures consistency across models

### Project Templates
Create reusable CLAUDE.md templates:
- React applications
- Node.js APIs
- Python data science
- DevOps workflows

### CI/CD Integration
```yaml
# .github/workflows/claude-check.yml
- name: Claude Code Analysis
  run: claude -p "Review PR and suggest improvements"
```

### Headless Mode Usage
```bash
# Non-interactive execution
claude -p "Run tests and generate report"

# With JSON output
claude -p "Analyze codebase" --output-format stream-json
```

## Security Considerations

### Sensitive Data
- Never include secrets in CLAUDE.md
- Use environment variables
- Configure MCP server permissions carefully
- Review what context is shared

### Access Controls
- Limit filesystem MCP server access
- Use read-only database connections where possible
- Audit MCP server configurations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Context too large**: Use `/compact` or `/clear`
2. **Commands not found**: Check `.claude/commands/` structure
3. **MCP server errors**: Verify installation and permissions
4. **High token usage**: Optimize CLAUDE.md and use headless mode
5. **Claude claiming completion when tasks remain**: Check todo.md
6. **Accuracy degradation**: Clear context and start fresh

### Preventing False Completions
Claude often claims "everything is complete" when tasks remain:

1. **Use Explicit Checklists**
   ```markdown
   # todo.md
   - [ ] Implement login API
   - [ ] Add password hashing
   - [ ] Create user model
   - [ ] Write tests
   ```

2. **Verification Prompt**
   ```
   Review todo.md and verify each item is actually complete.
   For each item, show me the code that implements it.
   ```

3. **Use Subagents for Verification**
   ```
   Use Task() to verify that all items in todo.md are complete
   ```

### Debug Commands
- `claude --verbose` - Show detailed execution
- Check logs in `~/.claude/logs/`
- Use `/bug` to report issues

## Review Process
Before submitting code:
1. Run all lint, check and test commands
2. Review compliance with standards
3. Verify documentation is updated
4. Check for security issues
5. **Verify all TODO items are complete**
6. **Double-check Claude's completion claims**
7. **Ensure commits use proper Git identity**
8. **Remove any AI attribution from commits**

## Task Tracking Template
Create a `todo.md` file for every session:
```markdown
# Task List - [Project Name]

## High Priority
- [ ] Fix authentication bug
- [ ] Update API documentation

## Medium Priority  
- [ ] Refactor user service
- [ ] Add logging

## Low Priority
- [ ] Clean up old migrations

## Completed
- [x] Setup database schema
- [x] Create user model
```

Update this file as you work and have Claude reference it frequently.

## Do Not
- Edit legacy code without explicit permission
- Commit directly to main branch
- Include sensitive data in prompts
- Use pip directly (use virtual environments)
- Ignore linting errors
- Make assumptions about implementation details
- Choose libraries or approaches without asking
- Assume file locations or naming conventions
- Implement features beyond what was requested
- Refactor code unless explicitly asked
- **Leave temporary or debug files in root directory**
- **Create files without proper documentation**
- **Skip commits during development**
- **Mix different file types in same directory**
- **Add Claude co-author attribution to commits**
- **Include AI-generated markers in commit messages**
